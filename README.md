<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
About The Project
-----------------
This python package provides tools for axis-symmetric cone-beam computed tomography. A Feldkamp David Kress algorithm performs the reconstruction
which have been adapted such that is exploits the axis-symmetric nature of the tomogram.

This toolkit has a highly specialised usage, and there are plenty of more general and excellent frameworks for tomographic reconstruction, such as:
 * [TomoPy](https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy) (General computed tomography, cone and parallel beam geometry)
 * [PyAbel](https://github.com/PyAbel/PyAbel) (Computed tomography based on the inverse Abel transform, parallel beam geometry)
 
 This project aims at providing a simple, accessible toolkit for forward-projection and reconstruction of 
 axis-symmetric tomograms based on a conical beam geometry.


### Built With
This project is heavily based on the following packages:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
Getting Started
---------------
To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Install via package manager:

The toolkit is available via PIP, and the instructions below shows how a virtual environment can be created
and the toolkit installed.

Prerequisites:

    This toolkit is tested on Python 3.6
    We recommend the use of virtualenv

Installing:

    $ virtualenv -p python3.6 env
    $ source ./env/bin/activate #On Linux and Mac OS
    $ env\Scripts\activate.bat #On Windows
    $ pip install axitom
    
Now the toolkit is installed and ready for use.

Run the tests:

    $ nosetests axitom

If you want to check out the examples, then download the files in the examples folder and run the examples.


### Clone the repo:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites:

    This toolkit is tested on Python 3.6
    We recommend the use of virtualenv


Clone this repo to your preferred location

    $ git init
    $ git clone https://github.com/PolymerGuy/axitom.git
    
We recommend that you always use virtual environments, either by virtualenv or by Conda env
    
    $ virtualenv -p python3.6 env
    $ source ./env/bin/activate #On Linux and Mac OS
    $ env\Scripts\activate.bat #On Windows
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can now run an example::
    
    $ python <path_to_axitom>/examples/comparison_to_Nikon.py

### Run the tests
The tests should always be launched to check your installation.
These tests are integration and unit tests.

If you cloned the repo, you have to call pytest from within the folder

    $ pytest


Example
-------
Let us now go through the necessary steps for doing a reconstruction of a tomogram based on a single image.
First, we need to import the tools

    import axitom as tom
    from scipy.ndimage.filters import median_filter

The example data can be downloaded from the AXITOM/tests/example_data/ folder. The dataset was collected during tensile testing of a polymer specimen.
Assuming that the example data from the repo is located in root folder, we can make a config object
from the .xtekct file

    config = tom.config_from_xtekct("radiogram.xtekct")

We now import the projection

     projection = tom.read_image(r"radiogram.tif", flat_corrected=True)

As we will use a single projection only in this reconstruction, we will reduce the noise content of the projection by
employing a median filter. Using such a filter works fine since the density gradients within the specimen are relatively small.
You may here choose any filter of your liking.


     projection = median_filter(projection, size=21)

Now, the axis of rotation has to be determined. The axis of rotation is found by first binarizing of the image into object and background,
and subsequently determining the centre of gravity of the object

     _, center_offset = tom.object_center_of_rotation(projection, background_internsity=0.9)

The config object has to be updated with the correct values

     config = config.with_param(center_of_rot=center_offset)

We are now ready to initiate the reconstruction

     tomo = tom.fdk(projection, config)


The results can then be visualized

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.title("Radial slice")
    plt.imshow(tomo.transpose(), cmap=plt.cm.magma)
